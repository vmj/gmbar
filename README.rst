Basic usage
===========

The program gmmembar produces a system memory bar, showing how much
memory is actively used, how much is used for file system buffers, and
how much is cached.  Following shows a typical invocation::

    $ gmmembar --interval=5 --logfile=gmmembar.log \
               --width=100 --height=10 --margin=1 --padding=1 \
               --fg=red --used=red --buffers=yellow --cached=orange

The program gmcpubar produces a system CPU bar, showing how much CPU
time is used in system, user, nice, and idle tasks.  Following shows a
typical invocation::

    $ gmcpubar --interval=1 --logfile=gmcpubar.log \
               --width=100 --height=10 --margin=1 --padding=1 \
               --fg=red --kern=red --user=orange --nice=yellow \
               --idle=green

The included C library provides the ability to make custom graphical
multibars easily easily.
